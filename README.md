##DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK(we explored various machine learning and data analysis techniques using Python, specifically focusing on classification, sentiment analysis, image classification, and recommendation systems. Each task was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment, which is widely used for data science projects due to its interactive nature and support for rich media outputs.
In the first task, we built a Decision Tree Classifier using the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning. The implementation utilized the scikit-learn library, which provides a robust set of tools for machine learning. The code involved importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, and training the Decision Tree model.
The second task focused on performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We utilized the pandas library for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning. The process involved creating a sample dataset of customer reviews, preprocessing the text data using TF-IDF vectorization, and training a Logistic Regression model to classify sentiments as positive or negative.
In the third task, we built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow. The CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, was used for training and testing the model. The implementation involved loading the dataset, normalizing the pixel values, and constructing a CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers. The model was compiled and trained, and its performance was evaluated on the test dataset.
The final task involved building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. We implemented a matrix factorization approach using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) from the surprise library. A sample user-item rating dataset was created, and the data was split into training and testing sets. The SVD algorithm was trained on the training data, and predictions were made for the test set.

Tools and Libraries Used
Throughout these tasks, we utilized several key libraries and tools:

Python: The primary programming language used for all implementations.
Jupyter Notebook: The code editor and environment used for interactive coding, visualization, and documentation.
scikit-learn: A powerful library for machine learning in Python, used for decision trees, sentiment analysis, and model evaluation.
TensorFlow: An open-source library for deep learning, used for building and training the CNN model.
pandas: A data manipulation library used for handling datasets in a structured format.
matplotlib: A plotting library used for visualizing results and model performance.
surprise: A library specifically designed for building and analyzing recommender systems.
